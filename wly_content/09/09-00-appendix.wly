                        Dieses Kapitel sind ausschließlich persönliche Notizen für mich dazu,
                        wie man "korrekt" dieses Skript schreibt, insbesondere wie man die
                        automatische Numerierung verwendet. Es ist also natürlich nicht Stoff
                        der Vorlesung.
                    Parts of these lecture notes are generated automatically with
                    javascript. This includes chapter and subchapter numbering, links to
                    next and previous chapters, the table of content, and theorem
                    numbering.

                            If you want to add a new chapter, you have to do two things: add an
                            entry to
                            |> a
                                href=../javascript/table-of-contents.js
                                table-of-contents.js
                            .
                            Just follow the format there. Then add the linked file. Best to
                            copy an existing file, a "chapter" or a "subchapter" file, depending
                            on the new file you want to create. The ordering in which they
                            appear (in the table of content and in the link structure given by
                            the `next` nad `prev` navigation links) is
                            determined purely by the order in which they appear in
                            |> a
                                href=../javascript/table-of-contents.js
                                table-of-contents.js
                            .

                            Theorem environments (theorems, lemmas, conjectures) can be created
                            as follows:
                            |> Statement
                                title=*Sauer-Shelah lemma*
                                Let $A \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. If $|A| \gt {\rm vol}(n,r-1)$ then
                                there exists some set $I \subseteq [n]$ of indices with $|I|
                                \geq r$ such that
                                \begin{align*} \{ \mathbf{x}_I \ | \ \mathbf{x} \in A\} =
                                \{0,1\}^r \ , \end{align*} in other words, the set $I$ of
                                coordinates is shattered.
                            and here is the source code:
                            |> pre
                                <div class='well container theorem'>
                                <p><span class='numbered-title' id="sauer-shelah-lemma" data-label-title="Lemma">Lemma</span>
                                <strong>(Sauer-Shelah lemma).</strong>Let $A \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$. If $|A| \gt {\rm vol}(n,r-1)$ then
                                there exists some set $I \subseteq [n]$ of indices with $|I| \geq r$ such that</p>
                                \begin{align*}
                                \{ \mathbf{x}_I \ | \ \mathbf{x} \in A\} = \{0,1\}^r \ ,
                                \end{align*}
                                in other words, the set $I$ of coordinates is shattered.
                                </div class='well container theorem'>
                            You must give the environment `div` the class
                            `theorem` and the title `span` the class
                            `nunbered-title`, otherwise the automatic numbering will
                            not work.
                            The attributes `id="sauer-shelah-lemma"` and
                            `data-label-title="Lemma"` are necessarily for
                            automatic referencing. Here is how you create a reference:
                            |> Highlight
                                This follows easily from the
                                |> span
                                    data-ref=sauer-shelah-lemma
                                    class=reference
                                \ just
                                above and
                                |> span
                                    data-ref=theorem-N-N^2
                                    class=reference
                                .
                            and here is the source code:
                            |> pre
                                Remember that<span class="reference" data-ref="theorem-N-N^2"></span> shows that $\N$ and $\N^2$ are equipotent.
                        To work, the `id` of a theorem (or a general environment)
                        has to be unique _across all files of the lecture notes_.
                        Also, since we have to correctly compute the numbering of theorems
                        like 
                        |> span
                            data-ref=theorem-N-N^2
                            class=reference
                        , we
                        would have to read the file containing it. So we'd have to write
                        code that, while loading Chapter 9, loads all chapters of referenced
                        environments. Potentially, this forces the browser to load
                        _the entire lecture notes_ each time a single file is loaded.
                        This would take too much time, so we use a precompilation step:
                        I wrote an html page
                        |> a
                            href=../javascript/put-all-in-one-page.html
                            put-all-in-one-page.html
                        that loads the table of content and all chapters (which takes quite
                        a substantial amount of time, like 20 seconds or so) and extracts
                        all environments with class `theorem` or
                        `exercise` that have also class
                        `numbered-title` and numbers them. If the environment has
                        the attribute `data-label-title`, then it adds an entry
                        to a global dictionary. At the end, when all has been loaded, the
                        web page will show this dictionary as a json object.
                        You should then copy this table and paste it in the beginning of the
                        file
                        |> a
                            href=../javascript/number-my-theorems.js
                            nunmber-my-theorems.js
                        . The point is that creating the table is expensive (must read all
                        chapters) but using it is cheap.
                        |> div
                            class=alert-warning
                            *Important:* 
                            \ The page
                            |> a
                                href=../javascript/put-all-in-one-page.html
                                put-all-in-one-page.html
                            does not work if you just open it by double-clicking in your file
                            explorer. It has to be hosted by an http-server server with CORS
                            enabled, for example
                            |> pre
                                \ http-server .  --cors
                            Once this server is running, go to
                            `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
